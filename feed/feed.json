Here are the steps I've taken so far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new GitHub project using <a href=\"https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog\">Elventy Base Blog</a> as a project template.</li>\n<li>Used the yml from <a href=\"https://www.rockyourcode.com/how-to-deploy-eleventy-to-github-pages-with-github-actions/\">How to deploy eleventy to github pages with github actions</a> in a new file <a href=\"https://github.com/david-risney/blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_eleventy.yml\"><code>.github/workflows/build_eleventy.yml</code></a>.</li>\n<li>I updated some version numbers, and added a permissions contents write per the <a href=\"https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-first-deployment-with-github_token\">peaceiris/actions-gh-pages help</a>.</li>\n<li>I also made sure to create the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>\n<li>And in the GitHub project's Settings | Pages, set Source to <code>Deploy from a branch</code> and Branch to <code>gh-pages</code>.</li>\n<li>Then I needed to <a href=\"https://github.com/david-risney/blog/commit/583048de085a4dda89ef23f63b8a454ae889376a\">update the pathPrefix setting</a> to <code>/blog/</code> to match my project name.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With this I've got Eleventy mostly setup and running on GitHub with GitHub Pages to serve the blog and GitHub Actions to rebuild the site whenever I push. Next up, how do I find a better site layout? And after that, the much harder problem of can I move my existing blog content over to this? Maybe in the interim just merge this blog content into deletethis.net.</p>\n",
