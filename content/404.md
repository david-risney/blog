# Content not found.

So you can't find some content.

* Try going <a href="/dave/">home</a> and looking around.
* Maybe its on the <a id="oldBlogLink" href="https://please.deletethis.net/dave/">old blog</a>.
* Or I don't know... maybe <a id="waybackLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://deletethis.net/dave/">the wayback machine</a> can help.

<script>
    document.getElementById("oldBlogLink").setAttribute("href", `https://please.deletethis.net${location.pathname.replace(/\/$/, "") + location.search}`);
    document.getElementById("waybackLink").setAttribute("href", `https://web.archive.org/web/*/${location.href.replace(/\/$/, "").replace(/\/\?/, "?")}`);
</script>
