  I previously described my desire to <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsupport%2Fcalendar%2Fbin%2Fanswer.py%3Fanswer%3D89955">hook my Outlook calendar up to my
  Google calendar</a>. I just found out that I can do this and the reverse as both support publishing calendars to the Internet. The following are how I set this up under Outlook 2010 and Google
  Calendar:<br /><br />
  In Outlook, I go to the calendar view, right click on my calendar and select "Share Publish to Office.com". At this point I can change the permissions to allow anonymous Internet access, and under
  Detail change between 'Full details' (full calendar), 'Limited details' (subject lines &amp; availability only), 'Availability only'. Availability only is almost just what I want -- I'd also like to
  include location but availability only is good enough. After hitting OK here I get a 'Do you want to send an invitation...' dialog box. I hit 'Yes' and I can copy the webcals:// URL out of the
  email window that opens up. Next, to add it to my Google calendar, I open <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/">http://www.google.com/calendar/</a>, and under 'Other calendars', I select 'Add
  Add by URL', paste in that webcals:// URL but change the 'webcals' at the start to 'https'.<br /><br />
  In Google Calendar, I can click on my calendar name under 'My calendars', select 'Calendar settings', and on the new page, look under 'Calendar Address', click the ICAL icon, and copy the URL in
  the new dialog. Now back in Outlook I go to the Calendar view, right click on 'My Calendars', and select 'Add Calendar From Internet...'. In the new dialog that pops up I paste in the URL from
  Google Calendar.<br /><br />
  In this fashion I can share public calendar data between my personal and work calendars.
