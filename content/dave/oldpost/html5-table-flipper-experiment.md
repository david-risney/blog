    The goal of this experiment was to combine the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/flipping-tables-%E2%95%AF%E2%96%A1%EF%BC%89%E2%95%AF%EF%B8%B5-%E2%94%BB%E2%94%81%E2%94%BB">flipping tables
    emoticons</a> with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ&amp;ob=av3e">Threw It On The Ground video</a> using shiny new HTML5-ish features and the end result is <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/dev/flip/">the table flipper flipping the Threw It On the Ground video</a>.
  </p><p>
    The table flipper emoticon is CSS before content that changes on hover. Additionally on hover a CSS transform is applied to flip the video upside down several times and move it to the right and
    there's a CSS transition to animate the flipping. The only issue I ran into is that (at least on Windows) Flash doesn't like to have CSS transform rotations applied to it. So to get the most out
    of the flip experiment you must <a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5">opt-in to HTML5 video on YouTube</a>. And of course you must use a browser that supports the various things I just
    mentioned, like the latest Chrome (or not yet released IE10).
