    Most existing DRM attempts to only allow the user to access the DRM'ed content with particular applications or with particular credentials so that if the file is shared it won't be useful to
    others. A better solution is to encode any of the user's horrible secrets into unique versions of the DRM'ed content so that the user won't <i>want</i> to share it. Entangle the users and the
    content provider's secrets together in one document and accordingly their interests. I call this Blackmail DRM. For an implementation it is important to point out that the user's horrible secret
    doesn't need to be verified as accurate, but merely verified as believable.

    Apparently I need to get these blog posts written faster because only recently I read about <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/columns-and-blogs/cory-doctorow/article/50413-with-a-little-help-digital-lysenkoism.html">Social DRM</a> which is a light weight version of my idea
    but with a misleading name. Instead of horrible secrets, they say they'll use personal information like the user's name in the DRM'ed content. More of my thoughts stolen and before I even had a
    chance to think of it first!
