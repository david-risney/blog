  To setup my home Windows dev box to be accessible from outside I followed two main steps:<br /><ul><li> Configure <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/allow-remote-desktop-connections-from-outside-your-home-network">my router to forward the remote desktop port.</a></li><li> Setup a <a href="http://www.dnsdynamic.org/">free dynamic DNS service.</a></li></ul>Last time I had to do this there was a service named dynamicdns.org which seems to still exist but no longer appears to be free. Instead I used dnsdynamic.org which is free and has a web API
  as well as links to and instructions for setting up native tools to dynamically update my IP address.
