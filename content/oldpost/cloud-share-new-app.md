    I've put a new app on the Windows Store: <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/a2b392c8-a94e-44ab-b52b-dea2c6c93572">Cloud Share</a>. It connects the web to your Windows 8 share
    charm.

    I did the <a href="https://github.com/david-risney/WebShare">development on GitHub</a> and quite enjoyed myself. I wasn't sure I liked the game-ification of development in GitHub's dashboard
    showing you your longest development streak in days. However I realized that it encourages me to do work on my personal project and anything that aids in holding my attention on and helping me
    finish these projects is a good thing.
