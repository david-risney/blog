  As it turns out the <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/wpadserverfiddlerextension/">WPAD Server Fiddler Extension</a> I made <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcerealnumber.livejournal.com%2F51588.html">a while back</a> actually has a non-malicious purpose. Apparently its useful for debugging HTTP on the WP7
  phone (or so I'm told). Anyway I took some requests and I've fixed a few minor bugs (start button not updating correctly), changed the dialog to be a Fiddler tab so you can use it non-modally, and
  the WPAD server is now always off when Fiddler starts.
