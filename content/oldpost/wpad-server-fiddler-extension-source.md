    I've put my <a href="https://github.com/david-risney/WpadServerFiddlerExtension">WPAD Fiddler extension source</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/david-risney/WpadServerFiddlerExtension/releases">installer</a> on GitHub.
  </p><p>
    Six years ago I made a WPAD DHCP server Fiddler extension (described <a href="https://deletethis.net/dave/2010-01/WPAD+Server+Fiddler+Extension">previously</a> and <a href="https://deletethis.net/dave/2011-06/WPAD+Server+Fiddler+Extension+Update+v1.0.1">previously</a>). The extension runs a WPAD DHCP server telling any clients that connect to connect to the running
    Fiddler instance. I've finally got around to putting the source on GitHub. I haven't touched it in five or so years so this is either for posterity or education or something.
