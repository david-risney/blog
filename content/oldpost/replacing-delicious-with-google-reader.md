title: "Replacing Delicious with Google Reader"

    I had previously replaced my use of Delicious with Google Reader. Delicious had a number of issues during their switch over from Yahoo to the new owners and I was eventually fed up enough to
    remove it from daily use. I used Delicious to do the following things:
  </p><ul><li>Create a list of things to read later
    </li><li>Save things to read again in the future
    </li><li>Search through things I read and enjoyed (esp via tags)
    </li><li>Annotate and share things on my blog
    </li></ul>I realized that since I did most of my web browsing in Google Reader now anyway I may as well make use of its features. I star things to note I want to read it later or save to read again
  later. I can annotate with notes in Google Reader and I can share items to my web site by way of the shared items feed. Additionally for when I'm not in Google Reader there's a bookmarklet to add
  an arbitrary web site as a shared item in Google Reader.
  <p>
    Of course I wrote this and switched over about 1 week before Google removed the sharing feature from Google Reader. I'm irritated but in practice it forced me to find a different option which has
    worked out mostly better. New blog post coming soon about that...
