      My third completed Windows Store app is <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/percent-clock/e1560938-5720-4b5f-a19e-707f1b68e09f/">Percent Clock</a> which displays portions of a
      time span like the time of the day or time until your next birthday, as a percentage. This was a small project I had previously started as a webpage and converted and finished as an HTML
      JavaScript Windows Store app.

      The only somewhat interesting aspect of this app is that its the first app for which I tried charging. I picked the minimum amount for price 1.49 USD as it is a simple app and unsurprisingly it
      has sold very poorly. I'm considering releasing new instances of the app for specific scenarios:
    </p><ul><li>Death Clock: viewing your current age with respect to your life expectancy as a percentage.
      </li><li>New Year Countdown: percentage of the year until New Years.
      </li></ul></div></div></div>
