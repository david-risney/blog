  In Windows 8 you can still <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767914(v=VS.85).aspx">register a desktop application to handle a particular URI scheme</a>, but now you can also
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh452686.aspx">register a Metro Win8 application to handle a particular URI scheme</a>. No more manually modifying the registry - now
  there's pretty UI in VS to handle this.
