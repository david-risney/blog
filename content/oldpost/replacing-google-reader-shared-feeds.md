    Last time I wrote about how <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdavescoolblog.blogspot.com%2F2011%2F11%2Freplacing-delicious-with-google-reader.html">I switched from Delicious
    to Google Reader's shared links feature</a> only to find out that week that <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/upcoming-changes-to-reader-new-look-new.html">Google was removing the
    Google Reader shared links feature</a> in favor of Google Plus social features (I'll save my Google Plus rant for another day).
  </p><p>
    Forced to find something new again, I'm now very pleased with <a href="http://sequelguy.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. Google Reader has Tumblr in its preset list of Send To sites which makes it
    relatively easy to add articles. And Tumblr's UX for adding things lets me easily pick a photo or video to display from the article - something which I had put together with a less convenient UX
    on my bespoke blogging system. For adding things outside of Google Reader I made a <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/activity/">Tumblr accelerator</a> to hookup to the Tumblr Add UX.
  </p><p>
    Of course they have an RSS feed which I hooked up to my blog. The only issue I had there is that when you add a link (and not a video or photo) to Tumblr, the RSS feed entry title for that link
    is repeated in the entry description as a link followed by a colon and then the actual description entered into Tumblr. I want my title separate so I can apply my own markup so I did a bit of
    parsing of the description to remove the repeated title from the description.
