    Stripe is running a <a href="https://stripe-ctf.com/about">web security capture the flag</a> - a series of increasingly difficult web security exploit challenges. <a href="https://stripe-ctf.com/progress/SequelGuy">I've finished it</a> and had a lot of fun. Working on a web browser I knew the theory of these various web based attacks, but this was my first chance
    to put theory into practice with:
  </p><ul><li>No adverse consequences
    </li><li>Knowledge that there is a fun security exploit to find
    </li><li>Access to the server side source code
    </li></ul><p>
    Here's a blog post on the <a href="https://blog.gregbrockman.com/2012/08/system-design-stripe-capture-the-flag/">CTF behind the scenes setup</a> which has many impressive features including
    phantom users that can be XSS/CSRF'ed.

    I'll have another post on my difficulties and answers for the CTF levels after the contest is over on Wed, but if you're looking for hints, try out the <a href="https://answers.stripe.com/chat#ctf">CTF chatroom</a> or the <a href="https://answers.stripe.com/chat#level4">level specific CTF chatroom</a>.
