    I've been working on the <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/dev/glitch-helperator/">Glitch Helperator</a>. It is a collection of tools and things I've put together for <a href="http://www.glitch.com">Glitch</a>. It has a few features that I haven't seen elsewhere including:
  </p><dl><dt>
      Favorite Streets
    </dt><dd>
      A notebook in which you can save information about interesting streets and later use it to find your way back to them.
    </dd><dt>
      Birthday
    </dt><dd>
      Find out how old your Glitch is and the date of your next birthday in Glitch time or Earth time.
    </dd><dt>
      API Update History
    </dt><dd>
      A history of changes to the streets, skills and achievements of Glitch noting when new ones are added and when existing ones are changed.
    </dd></dl>It also has an interactive skill tree, find nearest feature tool, and achievement display. If you play Glitch, check it out.
