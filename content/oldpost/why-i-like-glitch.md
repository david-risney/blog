    Sarah and I have been enjoying <a href="http://www.glitch.com">Glitch</a> for a while now. Reviews are <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/11/glitch-the-battle-to-build-a-massive-multiplayer-game-without-combat.ars">usually positive</a> although occasionally <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/10/04/review-glitch/">biting (but mostly accurate)</a>.

    I enjoy Glitch as a game of exploration: exploring the game's lands with hidden and secret rooms, and exploring the games skills and game mechanics. The issue with my enjoyment coming from
    exploration is that after I've explored all streets and learned all skills I've got nothing left to do. But I've found that even after that I can have fun writing client side JavaScript against
    <a href="http://developer.glitch.com/">Glitch's web APIs</a> making tools (I work on the <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/dev/glitch-helperator/">Glitch Helperator</a>) for use in Glitch. And
    on a semi-regular basis they add new features reviving my interest in the game itself.
