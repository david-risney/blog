    I'm done playing <a href="http://polytroncorporation.com/what-is-fez">Fez</a>. The style is atmospheric retro nastalgia and on the surface the gameplay is standard 2D platformer with one
    interesting Flatland style game mechanic but dig deeper to find Myst style puzzles. Despite the following I thoroughly enjoyed the game and would recommend it to anyone intrigued by the previous.
    Five eighths through the game I ran into one of the game's infamous <a href="http://polytroncorporation.com/fez-issues">Fez save game breaking issues</a>, but I enjoyed the game enough that I
    started over before any patches were released and had no further issues.

    While playing the game I created some tools to help keep track of <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/dev/fez/">my Fez notes (spoilers)</a> including a <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/dev/fez/pixelatedDataUriGenerator.html">Pixelated Image Creator</a> that makes it easy to generate data URIs for large, black and white pixelated images, and
    (spoilers) a <a href="http://deletethis.net/dave/dev/fez/fezTransliteration.html">Fez Transliteration Tool</a> to help me translate the in-game writing system.
