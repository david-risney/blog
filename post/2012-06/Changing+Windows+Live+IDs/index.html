<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div><p>
    Use of my old Hotmail account has really snuck up on me as I end up caring more and more about all of the services with which it is associated. The last straw is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/26/signing-in-to-windows-8-with-a-windows-live-id.aspx">Windows 8 login</a>, but previous straws include Xbox, Zune, SkyDrive, and my Windows 7 Phone.
    I like the features and sync'ing associated with the Windows Live ID, but I don't like my old, spam filled, hotmail email address on the Live ID account.
  </p><p>
    A coworker told me about <a href="http://pablodiaz.pro/?p=11">creating a Live ID from a custom domain</a>, which sounded like just the ticket for me. Following the instructions above I was able
    to create a new deletethis.net Live ID but the next step of actually using this new Live ID was much more difficult. My first hope was there would be some way to link my new and old Live IDs so
    as to make them interchangeable. As it turns out there is a way to <a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2007/10/26/link-your-windows-live-accounts.aspx">link Live IDs</a> but all that does
    is make it easy to switch between accounts on Live Mail, SkyDrive and some other webpages.
  </p><p>
    Instead one must change over each service or start over depending on the service:
  </p><dl><dt>
      Xbox
    </dt><dd>
      In the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-live-id#3c34347c60454eff8dd78d8b34be7a6d">Xbox 360 system menu you can change the Live ID</a>
      associated with your gamertag. This worked fine for me and I got an email telling me about the transfer of my Microsoft Points.
    </dd><dt>
      Zune
    </dt><dd>
      There's no way to do this for the Zune specifically, however changing over your Xbox account <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/zune/forum/account-net/zune-account-associated-with-false-e-mail/0abcf8b5-be0f-47b0-a56f-0bfe1fdc9e9b">also transfers over all your Zune purchased
      content</a>. I don't have a Zune Pass so I can't confirm that, but all of my previously purchased television shows transferred over successfully.
    </dd><dt>
      Windows 7 Phone
    </dt><dd>
      To change the main Live ID associated with your phone, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2430020">reset your phone to factory default</a> and start over. All purchased applications are
      lost. Had I purchased any applications I would have been pissed, but instead I was just irritated that I had to reset my phone.
    </dd><dt>
      Mail
    </dt><dd>
      I don't use my Hotmail account for anything and it only sits and collects spam. Accordingly I didn't attempt switching this over.
    </dd><dt>
      SkyDrive
    </dt><dd>
      I didn't have much in my SkyDrive account. I downloaded all files as a zip and then manually uploaded them to the new account.
    </dd></dl></div></div>
